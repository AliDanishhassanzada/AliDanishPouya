            <h3>Instractor </h3>
            <h5>(2019-2020)</h5>
            <p>
              in one year, I have worked as an instructor in software engineering courses.
               In these courses, I taught core software engineering concepts and programming 
               languages such as Python, PHP, JavaScript, and web technologies. My responsibilities 
               included designing course curricula, delivering both theoretical and practical
                lessons, preparing assignments, and assessing student projects. My goal was to
                 familiarize students not only with theoretical concepts but also with the 
                 real-world challenges and techniques used in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to teaching, I served as a mentor, assisting students with
               their hands-on projects and guiding them through various stages of software
                development, from requirement analysis to implementation and testing. 
                This experience allowed me to enhance my communication skills and adopt 
                innovative teaching methods, making the learning process more engaging and
                 effective for students.

               performance by fixing bugs. My experience with various frameworks 
               and version control tools like Git and GitHub has allowed me to work effectively in 
               team environments and on complex projects.
            </p> 
            <p>
              During this time, I gained hands-on experience with Agile and Waterfull methodologies.
              Additionally, I have developed skills in analyzing complex
                issues and providing optimal solutions for software problems. My ability to
